Basic steps to run Railo using Apache as the web server.


= Details =
 * UnRar the files and run setup_xampp.bat
 * run setup_xampp.bat
 * run startRailo.bat and wait until it finishes starting Railo and Resin
 * run apache_start.bat
 * Open http://localhost/index.cfm in a browser and set up the Railo Administrator
 * Open http://localhost/ and set up XAMPP
 * run the other start and stop bat files to start and stop the other servers like mysql_start.bat for mysql


Note: xampp-control.exe will not work correctly. I am assuming that both Railo's and Apache's executable are named httpd.exe
